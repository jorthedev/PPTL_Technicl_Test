Job search application


## Features

It does not show results for any jobs that have the word "Prison" in it

Once a search result job title has the keyword "Specialist" in it, the result will be starred

Users will be able to save a search result and view it on the 'Saved Jobs' Page

## Important Note

If you are not using localhost, please change the connection settings in the databaseClass.php file to match up to your server connection.
